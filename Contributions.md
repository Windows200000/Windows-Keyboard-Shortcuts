## What shortcuts to add
Application-specific shortcuts should be done for Microsoft or popular generic apps (i.e. Browsers, File Explorer...) only and have their own category.

## Translations
Translations are currently being done manually via ChatGPT with the following prompt:
```
Don't include code blocks in your answer.
To the very beginning, add a line saying "This text was translated to {Language} by ChatGPT." This declaration should also be in {language} and without the quotes.

Translate the following, including the line informing about the translation that you added, to {language}. STAY AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL TEXT AS POSSIBLE, copy it SENTENCE BY SENTENCE, almost WORD BY WORD. Stay as close as you can to translating it word by word, while keeping correct {language} grammar. Keep the context of windows shortcuts in mind when translating words. Don't translate names (i.e. Microsoft Word shouldn't be translated). Keep the markdown formatting as-is.

Additionally, translate the line "This text was translated to {Language} by ChatGPT." to {language}.

I will send you the language and the text to translate in the next message.
```

The next message is, for example, "{czech}" followed by [README.md](./README.md) in markdown format.
