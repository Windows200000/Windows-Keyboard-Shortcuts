# Windows-Keyboard-Shortcuts
An attempt at an as complete as possible list of Windows shortcuts.

## Contributions
If someone knows a way to keep the column width consistent, please help!\
Feel free to add more categories and suggest changes to categories.\
Application-specific shortcuts should be done for Microsoft or popular generic apps (i.e. Browsers, File Explorer...) only and have their own category.

## General
Most of these require support from the app.
